# interpreter

This project serves multiple purposes for me while I am changing my development workflow. 

About a week before this repo was created I switched all my keyboard layouts to Dvorak, found a great deal on a used Kinesis Advantage 2 to start using, and decided to change my IDE from PHP Storm to Neovim. 

Since I'm already changing so much I decided to add a few other things in the mix. I wanted to better understand interpreters and compilers by writing them and to try a new language.

I was recommended [Thorsten Ball's book](https://interpreterbook.com) which answers both calls to action.

I'm not entirely sure what my opinion on Go is yet.

The last thing I have added was simply to commit something everyday.
