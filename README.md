# interpreter

This project serves multiple purposes for me while I am changing my development workflow. 

About a week before this repo was created I switched all my keyboard layouts to Dvorak, found a great deal on a used Kinesis Advantage 2 to start using, and decided to change my IDE from PHP Storm to Neovim. 

Here is a list of things I will expand upon regarding what I'm up to:
- Dvorak
- Neovim
- [Thorsten Ball's book](https://interpreterbook.com)
- Go
- Github Challenge
